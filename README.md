# BIGINT_IMPLEMENTATION-IN-C

In C/C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a maximum of 20. And if we want to store the 22 digit number it is not easy to store it in any kind of primitive type. So to deal with this type of problem we design a new data type called BigInt.

We are going to store our numbers in the form of characters as using strings we can store very big numbers also.
